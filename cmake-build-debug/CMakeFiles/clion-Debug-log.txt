CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:9 (add_executable):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target game because there is
  a cycle in the constraint graph:

    dir 0 is [/Users/abdulkafi/VulkanSDK/macOS/lib]
      dir 1 must precede it due to runtime library [libMoltenVK.dylib]
    dir 1 is [/usr/local/lib]
      dir 0 must precede it due to runtime library [libvulkan.dylib]
    dir 2 is [/Users/abdulkafi/glfw/lib]

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
